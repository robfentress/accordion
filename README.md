# Questions
- Does the person know they are in an accordion widget?
- Is the person confused by the disabled state of expansion buttons that control expanded sections?
- Does the person expand collapsed regions to fill in all the fields or do they overlook those in collapsed regions?
- Is the person able to use the down/up arrow key commands to move between expansion buttons?  Are they aware of that affordance?  Do they choose to use it?  Do they switch to a different screen reader mode or use a specific escape sequence to do so?
- Does the person use heading navigation to move between expansion buttons?
- Does the person use key commands other than arrow keys or heading navigation to jump past or to the end of an expanded section?
